# Node_Express_Handlebars

## Description
Using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM I created an app that logs text into a database (DB). It is able to pass information from the user to a DB where it is stored. It can also be removed by the user with a simple click of a button. This link is deployed on Heroku and uses JAWSBD. More information can be found at my github, see below. 

A screenshot of the deployed app.
